CSS Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. CSS is a language that is used to style and layout web pages. It can change the appearance of elements such as fonts, colors, backgrounds, and more. It can also create animations and other decorative features. CSS works by applying rules to elements that match certain selectors. CSS can be written in external files, internal style blocks, or inline attributes.
